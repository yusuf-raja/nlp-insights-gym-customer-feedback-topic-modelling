# Customer-Feedback-Insights-NLP-Topic-Modelling-for-Operational-Improvement

## Project Background

This project analyses customer reviews for a large, low-cost, high-volume fitness operator. The company operates multiple locations across the UK and Europe, offering flexible memberships and uniform service quality. Understanding customer sentiment and recurring complaints is critical for operational efficiency, member retention, and strategic planning.

The analysis leverages NLP techniques, topic modelling, and emotion analysis to convert unstructured text data into actionable insights, focusing on negative reviews to identify recurring pain points and operational risks.

## Recommendations 

Prioritise hygiene and facility maintenance at high-volume locations.

Implement staff training and accountability measures to reduce customer service complaints.

Monitor equipment availability and repair schedules to minimise downtime.

Track environmental conditions in gyms to prevent discomfort-related negative reviews.

Simplify membership access, cancellation, and multi-location usage procedures.

Use automated NLP pipelines to continuously monitor new reviews for emerging operational issues.

Focus interventions on locations with high concentrations of negative feedback, while applying learnings across similar sites.
