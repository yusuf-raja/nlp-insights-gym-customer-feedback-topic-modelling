# Customer-Feedback-Insights-NLP-Topic-Modelling-for-Operational-Improvement

### Project Background

This project analyses customer reviews for a large, low-cost, high-volume fitness operator. The company operates multiple locations across the UK and Europe, offering flexible memberships and uniform service quality. Understanding customer sentiment and recurring complaints is critical for operational efficiency, member retention, and strategic planning.

The analysis leverages NLP techniques, topic modelling, and emotion analysis to convert unstructured text data into actionable insights, focusing on negative reviews to identify recurring pain points and operational risks.
