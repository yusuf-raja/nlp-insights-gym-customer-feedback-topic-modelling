# 💬 Customer Feedback Insights: NLP Topic Modelling for Operational Improvement

---

## Project Background

This project analyses customer reviews for a large, low-cost, high-volume fitness operator across the UK and Europe. The goal is to understand customer sentiment and recurring complaints to improve operational efficiency, member retention, and strategic planning.

The analysis uses **NLP techniques**, **topic modelling**, and **emotion analysis** to convert unstructured text into actionable insights, with a focus on negative reviews to identify recurring pain points and operational risks.

## Executive Summary

### Primary Metrics
- **Top 3 recurring complaint areas:** Equipment, Staff, Facilities  
- **Locations with the most negative reviews:** Identified across regions

### Core Findings

- **BERTopic Modelling:** Ten key topics identified, consolidated into operational themes:  
  Cleanliness, Staff Interactions, Equipment Availability, Environmental Comfort

- **Emotion Analysis:** Anger primarily linked to immediate environmental failures, highlighting the importance of real-time facility management

- **Large Language Model Insights:** Refined topics into actionable categories, surfacing high-priority operational risks such as staff misconduct and facility maintenance failures  

- **Gensim LDA Validation:** Confirmed the dominance of equipment, staff, and facility concerns, providing statistical confidence for prioritisation

## Recommendations

- Prioritise hygiene and facility maintenance at high-volume locations  
- Implement staff training and accountability measures to reduce service complaints  
- Monitor equipment availability and repair schedules to minimise downtime  
- Track environmental conditions to prevent discomfort-related negative reviews  
- Simplify membership access, cancellation, and multi-location usage procedures  
- Use automated NLP pipelines to monitor new reviews for emerging operational issues  
- Focus interventions on locations with high concentrations of negative feedback, applying learnings across similar sites
